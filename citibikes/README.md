### Homework 3 (Part 3)
As part of Homework 3, we studied the impact of season on trip duration( of subscribers) using the citibike data.

Our presumption is that the subscribers of citibike are people who use citibike for specific purposes like going to subway, offices, markets etc. so, the usage pattern of subscribers must be fairly consistent for Summers and winters.

For our analysis, we took following data:
 *  2 (peak summer) months (July and August 2015)
 *  2 (peak winter) months (January and February 2015)

we combined the data for 2 summer months and  2 winter months. 
Our Null Hypotheses is defined as :
 *  H0: mu1 - mu2 = 0   (i.e. there is no impact of season on average trip duration of subscribers)


Our significance level is alpha = 0.05


### My Role in the collaboration
I (Sachin Verma) collaborated in development of Hypotheses with Yuan Lai and Priya.
I worked on developing the code to load the data using pandas, formatting it and plotting the graphs alongwith Yuan Lai.
