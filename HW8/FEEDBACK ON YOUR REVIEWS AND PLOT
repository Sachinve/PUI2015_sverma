your reviews were harsh, but on point, which was the right thing to do 10/10

NOTES ON PLOT
=============
[!alt text](Sachinve.png)

the plot is a simple stacked histogram. 

labels are too small for readability, both tick labels and axis labels and title (which is also missing a space between word and parenthesis)

colorblind compliant

===========

too m any categories: the difference in size cannot be told apart

x, y labels and ticks and title  too small

circles size and transparency used to convey the same information: this just makes things confusing.

=======


tick and axis labels are too small

the colors indicate the structure in the data nicely but the three shades are not distinguishable by people affected by the most common color blind variety

in general the default 3 datapoints in the legend should be substitute with a single point, as they are redundant, but in this case since the datapoints are small to allow to see the overlapping structure (presumably) the three datapoints are justified. 

10^0 should be replaced with 1, 10^1 with 10

======

the ticks and axis labels are too small 

the choice of binning is exceedingly small: this affects readability of the x axis and actually suggests the presence of structure that is not in the data (see Bayesian blocks for choosing binning size)

the x tick labels should be integers, not floats as they are birth years and there is no more granularity than year-level

a typo in the title should be corrected and the title should be more concise: that level of description is distracting and belongs to the caption. 

a compressed notation for the large numbers on the y axis would enhance readability
