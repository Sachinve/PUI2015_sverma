   * Axis labels are not done completely (Units are not mentioned).
   * Legend is really confusing, it is having too much information.
   * Fonts(and Font Sizes) are consistent.
   * Title of the plot is not describing the plot correctly. It should tell that you are comparing trip durations.
   * Overall, the plot is not good.
